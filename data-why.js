        title: "Hummingbird Ball-and-Socket Shoulder",
        category: "wildlife",
        comparison: "Hummingbird vs. Other birds",
        why: "Hummingbirds have a true ball-and-socket shoulder joint (gleno-humeral) that allows 180° rotation of the wing — they can flap UPWARD as forcefully as downward. This is what gives them hover capability + reverse flight + lateral flight. Other birds (including chickens, eagles) have a more restricted hinge-like shoulder; they can only generate downward thrust. Among domestic 'birds' (poultry, ducks), none can hover.",
        clinical: "Hummingbird metabolic rate is the highest of any vertebrate (~12× human BMR). They enter torpor at night to survive. Captive husbandry requires constant access to nectar — they will starve in 4-6 hours without food.",
        img: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Hummingbird_in_flight.jpg/640px-Hummingbird_in_flight.jpg",
        analogy: "Chickens are propeller aircraft (one direction of thrust only). Hummingbirds are helicopters — they can rotate the rotor blades to push air in any direction.",
        quiz: {
            question: "Why can hummingbirds hover but chickens cannot?",
            options: ["Bigger wings", "Ball-and-socket shoulder joint with 180° rotation", "Higher heart rate", "Hollow bones"],
            correctIndex: 1,
            explanation: "Hummingbird's true ball-and-socket shoulder allows full wing rotation → thrust in any direction → true hovering flight. Other birds have a more hinge-like shoulder."

        category: "wildlife",
        comparison: "Naked Mole Rat vs. Other mammals",
        why: "Naked mole rats are effectively COLD-BLOODED — they don't maintain a constant body temperature. They have minimal hair, very low metabolism, and survive on the constant 30°C of their underground burrows. They are also resistant to cancer, can live without oxygen for 18 minutes, and live 30+ years. The closest mammal to behaving like a reptile.",
        clinical: "Major research model — naked mole rats almost never get cancer. Understanding their high-molecular-weight hyaluronan + p53 pathway may reveal therapies for human cancer.",

        category: "wildlife",
        comparison: "Sea Lion vs. Dog",
        why: "The sea lion FLIPPER is a fully transformed dog forelimb: the humerus + radius + ulna shortened and broadened; the carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges elongated into paddle-like rays; soft webbing between digits. The same bones, same nerve plexus, same blood supply — just reshaped for water propulsion. A perfect example of homologous structure.",
        clinical: "Sea lion flipper diseases (cellulitis, fractures) treated based on dog anatomy knowledge — orthopaedic surgeons can identify each bone clearly. Stranded sea lions often need fluid therapy via venepuncture of the flipper using same techniques as dog cephalic vein.",
        img: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Sea_lion.jpg/640px-Sea_lion.jpg",

        comparison: "Walrus vs. Dog",
        why: "The walrus has the largest os penis (baculum) of any land mammal — up to 60 cm long. It's a structural support for prolonged mating in cold Arctic waters where blood-based hydraulics fail in the cold. The dog's os penis is much smaller (~10 cm). The need for a rigid scaffold in cold conditions = bigger bone.",
        clinical: "Walrus bacula are highly valued in Arctic indigenous cultures (carving, fertility symbolism). Walrus fossils with the baculum are key paleontological dating tools — they don't decay quickly.",

        analogy: "Imagine a dog's penis bone scaled up by 5× — that's what a walrus carries inside its body. The walrus is the gold-medalist of baculum length among mammals.",

        category: "wildlife",
        comparison: "Sloth vs. Dog",
        why: "Sloths hang upside-down from branches using CURVED HOOK CLAWS that don't actively grip — they passively lock the digit closed via tendon engineering, so the sloth uses ZERO muscle energy to hang. Combined with the lowest metabolism of any mammal (~40% of expected for body weight), sloths can survive on a leaf diet that no other mammal could.",
        clinical: "Sloths in captivity often die of stress + improper diet. Heart rate can drop to ~15 bpm during rest — heart-rate-based anaesthesia monitors give false alarms. Body temperature varies more than other mammals.",
        img: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Sloth.jpg/640px-Sloth.jpg",
        analogy: "A sloth's claws are like coat hooks — bend it once and it stays. No muscle needed to hold the coat. That's why a sloth can sleep upside-down for 15 hours a day.",

        why: "Crocodiles are the only reptiles with a TRUE 4-chambered heart (like birds and mammals) — but with a special twist: the FORAMEN OF PANIZZA, a permanent opening between the left and right aortic arches. This lets them SHUNT blood away from the lungs during long dives (up to 1 hour). Other reptiles (snakes, lizards) have only a 3-chambered heart.",
        clinical: "Captive crocodilians anaesthetized for surgery need careful monitoring because they can shunt blood to bypass anesthetic delivery to the lungs. The foramen of Panizza must be considered when interpreting blood gas analysis.",

        why: "Cheetahs are the only big cats with semi-non-retractable claws — they don't fully sheath. The exposed claws act as built-in running spikes for traction during 110 km/h chases. Other felids (lion, tiger, house cat) retract their claws to keep them sharp for climbing and prey-grappling. Cheetah trades grappling for speed.",
        clinical: "Cheetah claws wear down more than other cats — captive cheetahs need claw inspection during anaesthesia. Their long, thin legs are also more fracture-prone. Genetic bottleneck (extreme inbreeding ~10,000 years ago) makes them susceptible to disease.",
