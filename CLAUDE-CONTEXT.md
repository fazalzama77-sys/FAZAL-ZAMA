# CLAUDE CONTEXT — Paste at the Start of Any New Chat

Hey Claude! Read this whole file before doing anything else. It tells you who I am, what we're building, the codebase layout, my conventions, and how I prefer to work. After reading, just say "Got it — what do you want to work on?" and wait for my actual task.

## 👤 ABOUT ME

- **Name:** Fazal Zama
- **Role:** B.V.Sc & A.H. UG student at IVRI Bareilly (1st year, Roll No. B0-350-2025)
- **Background:** Veterinary science — **NOT a coder**. I don't speak code natively. Explain things in plain English with concrete file paths + simple steps.
- **Religion:** Muslim. I prefer content that's Islamically compliant — no explicit evolution language (use "designed/built", "vestigial" is OK), no Greek mythology references, no alcohol-related analogies, no idol/statue imagery.
- **Tools I use:** Windows PC, GitHub Desktop (not command-line git), File Explorer. I do NOT use a terminal. Always give me GUI-based instructions or one-click scripts.

## 🎯 WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

**IVRI Anatomy** — a free interactive veterinary anatomy study website + Android app for B.V.Sc 1st-year students, aligned with the VCI Unit 1-8 syllabus.

**Live URL:** `https://fazal-zama.pages.dev/` (Cloudflare Pages, deployed from GitHub repo)
**GitHub repo:** `https://github.com/fazalzama77-sys/FAZAL-ZAMA.git`
**Local working folder:** `D:/ANATOMY APP/repo/` ← **THIS IS THE ONLY FOLDER YOU SHOULD EDIT.** This folder IS the git repo connected to GitHub.

The deprecated old folder is `D:/kimi anatomy/`. **Never edit it.** If I accidentally point you there, gently steer me back to the repo folder.

### Sections of the site
1. **Atlas** — Regional anatomy: Introduction, Forelimb, Head & Neck, Thorax, Abdomen, Hindlimb & Pelvis, Histology, Embryology. (8 regions, each split by system: Osteology / Myology / Arthrology / Neurology / Angiology / Splanchnology.)
2. **WHY** — Biomechanical explanations + comparative anatomy + wildlife-vs-domestic. ~86 entries with quiz cards.
3. **Atlas Quiz** — MCQ / True-False / Fill-Blanks per region+system + Smart Review (SRS) + Exam Mode (timed mock).
4. **Dashboard** — Performance tracker, accuracy chart, topic heatmap, Smart Review panel (Leitner box SRS).
5. **Bookmarks** + **Mark-as-Read** + per-topic progress badge.

### Two themes
- **Student mode (default):** neon dark theme (cyan/gold accents on navy background) — **DO NOT CHANGE COLOURS HERE without asking**.
- **Professional mode:** clean medical light theme (whites + medical blue + soft greys) — toggled by button bottom-left.

### Data file shape
Every regional data file follows this pattern:
```js
atlasData["RegionName"] = {
  "Osteology": [
    {
      title: "Scapula",
      desc: "<b>standard view text</b><br>...",    // shown by default
      eliteDesc: "<b>elite/detailed view</b><br>...", // shown when Elite Toggle is on
      comparative: [
        { species: "Horse", note: "..." },
        { species: "Dog", note: "..." }
      ],
      clinical: "<b>Clinical:</b> ...",
      imgCode: "scapula",          // image key (optional)
      img: "images/atlas/scapula.webp" // direct URL (optional)
    },
    { ... next structure ... }
  ],
  "Myology": [...],
  // etc.
};
```

The WHY data is a single array of objects:
```js
anatomyData = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Equine Frog vs Bovine Digital Cushion",
    category: "hindlimb",   // forelimb | hindlimb | axial | wildlife
    comparison: "Horse vs. Ox",
    why: "...",
    clinical: "...",
    img: "images/why/...webp",
    analogy: "...",
    quiz: { question: "...", options: [...], correctIndex: 0, explanation: "..." }
  }
];
```

The quiz bank `data-quiz.JS` structure:
```js
quizBank = {
  "Forelimb": {
    "Osteology": {
      mcq: [ { q: "...", o: ["A","B","C","D"], a: 2, e: "explanation" } ],
      tf:  [ { q: "...", a: true, e: "..." } ],
      fib: [ { q: "...", a: ["accepted","alternatives"], e: "..." } ]
    },
    "Myology": { mcq:[], tf:[], fib:[] }
  }
};
```

## 🛠️ MY WORKFLOW (HOW I PUBLISH)

1. I edit images by dropping into `D:/ANATOMY APP/repo/images-raw/atlas/` or `/why/`
2. I double-click `tools/compress.bat` — auto-compresses to ~300 KB WebP
3. Edit happens in `D:/ANATOMY APP/repo/` (you edit here)
4. I open GitHub Desktop → see changes → write commit message → Commit → Push origin
5. Cloudflare Pages auto-rebuilds the live site within ~1 minute

**I never use git command-line.** Always give me file paths I can find in Explorer, not terminal commands.

## 🎨 STYLE / CODE CONVENTIONS

- **DON'T add features I didn't ask for.** Bound your work to exactly what I requested.
- **CSS scope changes carefully:** if I say "fix the WHY quiz", don't touch atlas-quiz CSS.
- **Student mode (default neon theme) is finished — don't change its colours.** Only fix professional mode or shared bugs.
- **Use vanilla JS** — no frameworks. The site is plain HTML + CSS + JS, served as static files.
- **Use `.innerHTML` for fields that may contain `<b>` / `<br>` / `<i>`** — never `.textContent` for those.
- **Don't introduce dependencies** without asking. No npm, no bundlers, no build step.
- **GPU-friendly animations only** — `transform` + `opacity`, avoid `box-shadow` / `filter` in `@keyframes`.
- **Always reset state flags in cleanup paths** — I've been burned twice by leftover `examMode = true` flags.
- **Avoid evolution language** — say "is built / is designed" not "evolved"; "vestigial" is fine; never "phylogenetic leftover" or "ancestor species".
- **Strip Greek mythology references** — "atlas vertebra carries the skull" instead of "named after the Greek titan".
- **Files use mixed-case extensions** (`data-forelimb.JS` not `.js`). Match my existing pattern when creating new ones.

## ⚙️ KEY ARCHITECTURE FACTS

- **Single-page app:** `index.html` is a section-switcher. Each section is a `<section class="view-section">`. Navigation by `view-section.active` class + hash routing (`#/atlas/Forelimb/Osteology/2`).
- **Image loading is already click-to-load:** Atlas modals only fetch images when user clicks a structure. WHY cards render text-only; image loads when user opens the modal. No lazy-loading library needed.
- **localStorage keys:** `ivri-theme`, `ivri-elite`, `ivri-bookmarks`, `ivri-read`, `ivri-srs-state`, `ivri-quiz-progress`, `ivri-highlights`, `ivri-notes`, `ivri-visits`, `ivri-onboarded`, `ivri-install-dismissed`, `ivri-activity` (streak map), `ivri-notify-srs`, `ivri-notify-last`.
- **PWA:** Service worker caches everything; app installs to Android home screen via `manifest.json`.
- **State globals:** `atlasData` (regional), `anatomyData` (WHY), `quizBank` (questions), `srs.*` (SRS engine), `quizApp.*` (quiz state).

### 🧭 Navigation architecture (v2 — premium-mobile redesign)

The app uses a **3-layer navigation model**. Respect these boundaries when adding features:

| Layer | Purpose | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **L1 — Primary destinations** | 5 stable slots: Atlas · WHY · Quiz · Library · Me | `#bottom-nav` — fixed bottom bar on mobile, reconfigures via CSS into a top-centered pill dock on desktop (≥901px). Component is the same; layout differs. |
| **L2 — Contextual actions** | Per-screen actions (Elite toggle, Highlight/Note/Share/Read/Bookmark on a topic) | Inline in the screen's `.nav-bar` (desktop) or `.detail-header-actions` row (atlas topic). Icon-only on mobile via CSS. |
| **L3 — Settings & meta** | Theme · Reset Cache · About · Search · Dashboard | All routed through the **Me** tab (`#me-view`). The old top-left theme toggle is hidden on mobile (`.theme-toggle-btn { display:none }` ≤900px). |

**Library is a unified hub** — Bookmarks + Highlights + Notes live behind the same Library route as 3 tabs. The legacy hashes (`#/bookmarks`, `#/highlights`, `#/notes`) still work — they redirect into Library with the right tab preselected.

**Quiz Mode is the center FAB** on mobile (raised, gold gradient). Stays one-tap reachable everywhere. Also has a desktop top-bar shortcut on the Atlas view.

**Bottom-nav auto-hide on scroll** is intentional — gives more vertical reading room when students are deep in content; reappears on scroll-up.

**Active-slot logic** lives in `app._refreshBottomNavActive()` — it maps URL hash + `app.state.view` to one of: `atlas | why | library | me` (Quiz never stays "active" — it opens an overlay, not a destination).

**When adding a new primary destination**, do NOT add a 6th bottom-nav slot — replace an existing one or nest the new thing into Library/Me. 5 slots is the proven limit (Google Material, iOS HIG).

**When adding a contextual action**, put it in the screen's L2 toolbar — never the bottom nav.

## 🐛 KNOWN PAST BUGS (don't reintroduce)

- `examMode` flag leaking — must reset to `false` in `start()`, `startSmartReview()`, `close()`, `resetSelections()`
- `<b>` tags showing literally in WHY modal — happens when `textContent` used instead of `innerHTML`
- Comparative tables not horizontally scrolling on mobile — `.comp-table` needs `overflow-x: auto; display: block`
- WHY mobile controls bar taking 1/3 of screen — has auto-hide-on-scroll behaviour, don't break it
- Splash lag — `filter: drop-shadow` in animation loop is the killer; use `transform` + static glow only
- Theme toggle overlapping mobile quiz buttons — fixed via `body.body-modal-open` class hiding toggle

## 🚀 HOW TO WORK WITH ME EFFICIENTLY

1. **Read this whole file first.** Don't ask "what's the project?"
2. **Be specific in your replies** — list file paths and exact changes.
3. **Don't over-explore.** I'll tell you the bug — go straight to the file.
4. **Verify state-reset paths** whenever you add a new flag. (See "Known Past Bugs".)
5. **If unsure between two approaches**, ask me ONE short question. Don't write code both ways.
6. **For big features**, give me a 5-line plan first. Wait for "yes go".
7. **End your responses with a "what to test" checklist** so I can verify quickly.

### 🎯 Engagement layer (v3)

Boot sequence (in `app._initEngagement`):
1. **Visit counter** (`ivri-visits`) bumps every load — drives install-banner timing.
2. **Daily activity log** (`ivri-activity`) records today's date — drives streak.
3. **Onboarding tour** — 5 slides, shown once on first visit. Re-triggerable from Me page (`app.replayOnboarding()`). Storage key `ivri-onboarded`.
4. **Install-as-app banner** — listens for `beforeinstallprompt`, shows after 2 visits. iOS fallback shows "Add to Home Screen" hint with the share icon.
5. **SRS daily notification** — fires browser Notification (no service-worker push) on app open if: permission granted, user enabled it, SRS items due, and not already fired today.

**Streak math** lives in `app._computeStreak()` — returns `{current, longest, totalDays}`. Counts backwards from today with a 1-day grace (if user hasn't logged today yet, counts from yesterday).

**Heatmap** in Me page uses `app._buildHeatmapData()` — last 84 days, grouped 12 cols × 7 rows.

**Audio pronunciation** uses the browser's `speechSynthesis` API — free, no API key, works offline. Trigger: speak-button next to Atlas topic titles + double-click any glossary term. Implemented in `app.speak(text)`.

---

## 🎨 DESIGN PRINCIPLES (applied throughout)

Treat these as guardrails when proposing UI changes:

1. **Thumb-zone first.** Anything tapped during normal use must sit in the bottom 60% of the viewport on mobile. The bottom nav follows this; so does the detail-panel action toolbar.
2. **Three taps max to any feature.** Bottom-nav (1) → Library tab (2) → item (3). Don't add deeper.
3. **Touch targets ≥44×44 px.** The mobile detail-toolbar icons hit this even when text is hidden.
4. **Animations are GPU-only.** `transform` + `opacity` in every keyframe. No `filter` / `box-shadow` animations (causes jank on Android).
5. **Hide-on-demand, never never-show.** Bottom nav auto-hides on deep scroll, but always returns on scroll-up. Never permanently hide primary nav behind a gesture.
6. **One mental model per surface.** Library = "stuff I saved." Me = "settings + about me." Atlas = "what I'm studying." Don't cross-pollinate.
7. **Backwards-compatible routes.** Every legacy `#/...` hash must still land somewhere sensible. Tested: `#/bookmarks`, `#/highlights`, `#/notes` all redirect into Library with the right tab.
