            clinical: "<b>Safety Protocols:</b> IVRA tourniquet must be released SLOWLY to prevent lidocaine toxicity (seizures). Never exceed 4mg/kg lidocaine total dose. <b>Troubleshooting:</b> If block fails, usually due to insufficient volume (bovine tissues require MORE than equine) or injection too proximal (tourniquet effect blocks diffusion). <b>Alternative:</b> When tourniquet contraindicated (infection, dermatitis), use specific nerve blocks rather than IVRA.",
